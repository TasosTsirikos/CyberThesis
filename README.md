# CyberThesis
Website project about creating an online system to make managing thesis work easier for students, professors, and the university staff.

It includes features like logging in, submitting thesis topics, assigning committees, and tracking progress. The system is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, MySQL and more, to be easy to use, reliable, and able to handle large amounts of data.

The goal is to solve common problems like delays in communication and keeping track of everything, and to help everyone involved work together more smoothly.
